## Vim grammar for Dragonfly / Caster
The initial source for this repository comes from [davitenio's dragonfly-macros](https://github.com/davitenio/dragonfly-macros). I picked it because it adhered to the modal separation that's essential to vim. My edits are designed to work with both dragonfly and castor. (This involves some difficulties that I am still ironing out.)

The main way in which this repository improves on the past work is that it maps vim's full grammar onto the voice commands. This means that the standard verb-object and verb-motion arguments will work.

In the longer run, I also plan to develop a grammar for search, command, and substitution.
